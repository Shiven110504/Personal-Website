# Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website! This site is a showcase of my journey as a computer science student at UMass Amherst, my skills, projects, and my passion for technology and innovation.

## Website Overview

The portfolio is a single-page application featuring a clean, modern design that highlights my experience and projects. The navigation bar allows easy access to different sections: Experience, Skills, Projects, and a Contact form. There's also a downloadable version of my resume for a more detailed look at my professional background.

## Technology Stack

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The entire portfolio is built using functional components and hooks for state management.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development. Tailwind's responsive design features are used extensively to ensure the portfolio looks great on all devices.
- **GitHub Pages**: The website is hosted on GitHub Pages, ensuring seamless deployment and updates.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The site is fully responsive and adapts to various screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops.
- **Interactive UI**: Engaging user interface with hover effects and smooth scrolling to enhance the user experience.
- **Live Updates**: The 'Experience' and 'Projects' sections are dynamically updated, allowing me to showcase my latest work and achievements.
